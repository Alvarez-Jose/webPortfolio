                                Undocumented Latinx students who transfer from community colleges to four-year universities face unique challenges that remain understudied in higher education research. This project examines how Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) either support or hinder the success of undocumented Latinx transfer students through institutional practices, campus climate, and staff perceptions. Through qualitative interviews with both undocumented Latinx transfer students and institutional staff at a public four-year HSI, we investigate how "servingness" is conceptualized and enacted in ways that impact educational access, belonging, and achievement for this overlooked student population. Our research illuminates the critical intersection of immigration status, transfer experiences, and institutional support mechanisms. Findings from this work aim to inform more intentional, equity-centered practices within HSIs to better serve undocumented students throughout their transfer journey. This project builds on existing frameworks of Transfer Receptive Culture and the Multidimensional Conceptual Framework of Servingness to develop practical recommendations for institutions committed to supporting undocumented student success.

                                This research is in collaboration with UCSC’s Cultivamos Excelencia Hispanic Serving Institution Initiative to understand the experiences of transfer students of color to cultivate positive transfer student outcomes. For the first phase of this project, our results highlight that staff are under-resourced and unsure of how to develop and direct services for transfer students of color. Staff reflect on needing more institutional support to address the needs of transfer students of color and increasing their knowledge about resources and barriers faced by these students. Currently, we are analyzing qualitative data from transfer focus groups. For more information, visit M.I.E.L.

                                Minoritized students can engage in research and are the experts in identifying the topics that affect their communities. Thus, we collaborated with middle school students, primarily Latinx students, to explore how Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) fosters belonging among students and their family members. YPAR involves collaborating with youth to research issues related to their lived experiences. The knowledge constructed using research aims to help youth resist oppression by acting toward social justice. Eight middle students were involved in an after-school class focusing on research, college preparation, and community building. They developed a research project on bullying at their school due to race, gender, and sexual orientation. Our project aims to assist educators and administrators develop more inclusive learning environments and the importance of research and action for students. For more information, visit M.I.E.L.
